Training plan website for the Chicago marathon 2016. 

The training plan lives in lib/assets/training_plan.store. 

This is a pretty simple site and I'm definitely open to improvements, some ideas I had:
- Ability to enter how much you actually ran that day. 
- A section to enter notes on each run.
